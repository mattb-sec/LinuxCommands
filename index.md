# Introduction

This lab will be covering a large scope of functionality in CentOS. It will begin with demonstrating common Linux commands through the performance of various steps. Then, the topic of security will be addressed regarding the machine’s bootloader and how it can be a potentially significant concern for security. Additionally, there will be a brief look at Linux’s “enhanced security” function. Finally, as a demonstration of the efficiency of yum and versatility of CentOS’s firewalls, there will be a brief activity wherein firewalls will be swapped back and forth.

# Practicing Basic Linux Commands

This lab will begin by briefly going over some key Linux commands. In this part of the lab, I will be using the command terminal to create directors and files, modify files, and install and use the text editor, Vim. After accessing my previously created virtual machine, I am ready to begin the lab.

## Step 1

To begin, I must create a new folder under the “root” directory. To do so, I type in the command, “mkdir ‘MATTHEW bhv873’”. The command “mkdir” creates a new folder in the terminal’s current directory path. After that, I simply follow the naming conventions as specified in the instructions. This folder will henceforth be referred to as my “abc123” folder.

- _Figure 1_: Creating the new folder. Notice how I included quotation marks in the name so that the “bhv873” after the space can be included. The “cd” command at the bottom will play a role in the next step.
